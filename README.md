# MarketBoy
The ultimate Swiss Army knife marketplace assistant

Quickly get NFT rarities and other attributes without leaving DigitalEyes or MagicEden. With a regularly growing list of supported collections, Market Boy aims to be the ultimate marketplace assistant. Know the value of your items, snipe great deals, and protect yourself from misleading sellers. We currently support:

Gmoot
Shapes
Inverse Bear Market
SGF United
Nifty Nanas
The Dimez
Red Panda Squad
Mechs of Solana
Crypto Idolz
The SolCube NFTs

While different collections have different numbers behind the scenes, general rarity rules remain the same. From rarest to most common, colors rank Orange, Purple, Blue, Green, and Grey. NFTs without listed ranks are either unranked, or the creators did not want to release rank data.

Note: Gmoot currently has issues on MagicEden with 1/1 items. This will be corrected soon.
